## Acoustic Indices

This folder is dedicated to calculated acoustic indices from .wav files. Many of the files are used for exploratory purposes (converting audio files into .wav format and coverting from stereo to mono audio files). 

### To calculate bioacoustic indicators:
Given a folder of .wav files who's bioacoustic indices need to be calculated, the Report.ipynb should be run. The folder path should be stated at the beginning of the file.
Lastly run all of the cells.
The csv file with all of the bioacoustic indicators for each file will be found in the path folder.
